# hello-world
First testing Repository

This is just a text I wrote, because the GitHub-Tutorial told me so.
I think I will smile, everytime I see it ;o)

Caused by actual use of Git at work I use this repo to really get used to a Github workflow. Therefore I, as the repo-name suggests, added a hello-world file.
